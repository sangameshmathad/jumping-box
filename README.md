# Jumping - Box

A very basic game similar to the one which we find on the chrome browser when there's no internet.It has two elements a block and a character. character jumps on mouse click and the block keep moving forward towards the character. if they collide, game's over.


## Further updates

User interface can be improved. A better imgae/png can be used for character and the block. As of now there's only one block. Multiple levels can be introduced, along with multiple blocks (or obstacles).
Score card to be added.
